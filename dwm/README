Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.
THIS FOLDER MUST BE /home/casenc/.config/suckless/dwm
THIS FOLDER MUST HAVE A SYMLINK TO MY SCRIPTS REPO CALLED `scripts` (or a submodule)
Please run `git submodule update --init` when cloning


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Get your .xinitrc to ~/.xinitrc

Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.

`dwmblocks` can be altered by editing `[variant].blocks.def.h` and recompiling just like dwm.


For battery events, `/etc/acpi/handler.sh` should be edited with the proper names seen when running `acpi_listen`. For example, if the output when unplugging the charger looks like:

    ac_adapter ACPI0003:00 00000080 00000000
    battery PNP0C0A:00 00000080 00000001
 
Then line 26 should be something like 

    case "$2" in
        AC|ACAD|ADP0|ACPI0003:00)

Since ACPI0003:00 is the name of the ac_adapter.
The following command can then be executed to refresh dwmblocks:
    
    $DWM/scripts/battery 1

Example of relevant section of `etc/acpi/handler.sh`:
case "$1" in 
    ...
    ac_adapter) 
        case "$2" in 
            AC|ACAD|ADP0|ACPI0003:00) #Notice the added line
                /home/casenc/scripts/battery 1 #The script to run, above the fourth case statement as the script must run regardless of whether the charger was plugged or unplugged
                case "$4" in 
                    00000000) 
                        logger 'AC unpluged' 
                        ;; 
                    00000001) 
                        logger 'AC pluged' 
                        ;; 
                esac 
                ;; 
            *) 
                logger "ACPI action undefined: $2" 
                ;; 
        esac 
        ;; 

Dependencies
-------------

* A scripts symlink/folder to the gitlab repo `git@gitlab.com:amatgilvinyes/scripts.git` is necessary for all keybinds/scripts to work properly
* A symlink from `./scripts/initialDisplay`  to one of the scripts in `./scripts/screenlayouts/`. It will be executed on startup to setup the display
* `acpi`
* `xmenu` (for `layoutmenu.sh`)
